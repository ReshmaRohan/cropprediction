			 	<h4>The Need for Climate Prediction Information for Agriculture*</h4>
			 	<p>Farmers grow crops on the field scale (individual farm acres impacted by field-scale climate factors) but sell crops into an international market (impacted by global-scale climatic factors).  Local climate predictions improve crop production planning and subsequently impact individual farmer yields.  Global and regional scale climate factors impact the prices farmers receive for their crop as well as their decisions of what crops to grow.</p>
			 	<p>Climate predictions of monthly, seasonal and yearly weather influence farmer decisions that are important to the individual growing season of a crop.  Multi-year and decadal predictions of weather influence farmer investment decisions that can span several growing seasons.</p>
			 	<p>To maximize the value of climate prediction information for decision making the information needs to be combined and provided with other environmental information such as ground cover, soil type, soil organic matter, soil radiation, soil temperature, soil moisture and long-term drought conditions.  This integration of environmental information will help farmers and agribusinesses utilize the information more effectively in decision making. </p>
			 	<p><b>Improve crop production planning --</b> Climate predictions of seasonal weather patterns (e.g., drought, heat waves, cool planting season) help farmers decide which crops are most likely to flourish in the predicted growing season.  This will impact their decisions of which crops to grow and how much of each crop to grow on their farms and whether to purchase crop insurance.  This is especially relevant in regions of the country where farmers traditionally grow a variety of crops.  In areas of the country where crop mix does not change, climate predictions help farmers decide on the relative proportions of each crop to grow.</p>
			 	<p><b>Improve production input planning -- </b> Farmers purchase a variety of crop inputs (e.g., fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides) that are utilized during various times of the growing seasons.  Timely climate prediction information can provide useful information for the type, amount, timing and type of application of crop inputs. </p>
			 	<p><b>Improved crop field operations planning -- </b> Crop yields are sensitive to the timing of field operations. Climate predictions will provide lead time to help farmers mitigate the effects of adverse weather during the planting season. Delayed planting can significantly reduce yields and make crops vulnerable to early frost in the fall.  Climate prediction information on expected “suitable planting field days” based on highly specific timing, amount, duration and special distribution of precipitation and evaporation during the planting season will help farmers prepare for periods of excessive rainfall.  Information on expected soil temperatures and the timing of the last killing frosts can help farmers identify the optimum time for planting.</p>
			 	<p><b>Improve crop field-level investment decisions -- </b> In addition to the growing season decisions outlined above, farmers have a variety of longer-term decisions that require multi-year and/or decadal climate predictions. Future precipitation levels and the variability and intensity of precipitation events can significantly impact crop yields.  Both too little soil moisture and too much soil moisture will reduce crop yields.  Climate predictions can provide essential information for decision makers of whether to install irrigation systems or drainage systems to optimize crop yields. </p>
			 	<p><b>Mitigate negative soil impact -- </b> Productive soils can be severely impacted by extreme weather events.  Intense rainfall on saturated soils will result in substantial washing of soils particles into streams and waterways.  Once erosion occurs on soils it is virtually impossible to correct the damage because soils form over hundreds and thousands of years.  Eroding soils also negatively impact water quality in streams and rivers. </p>
			 	<p><b>Improve crop marketing and planning -- </b> Global-scale climate predictions help assess national and world crop production levels.  These assessments of production levels are a major driver in determining the price of agricultural crop commodities.  Due to the dwindling inventories of world grains, prices levels are extremely sensitive to small changes in expected production.  This leads to large swings in grain prices and the opportunity for speculative investing to increases price volatility.  Volatile markets increase the financial risk of producers and processors</p>
